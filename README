sysrqd is a small daemon intended to manage Linux SysRq over network.

Its philosophy is to be very responsive under heavy load and try to be
somehow reliable.

Authentication is made by clear password.

Connection should be made to port 4094.

sysrqd          4094/tcp   sysrq daemon
sysrqd          4094/udp   sysrq daemon
