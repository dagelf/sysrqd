sysrqd is a small daemon intended to manage Linux SysRq over network.
Its philosophy is to  be very responsive under heavy load  and try to be
somehow reliable.
Authentication is made by clear password.

Connection should be made to port 4094.

*** WARNING ***
Please, be careful if you use 'e'  (tErm) and 'i' (kIll). This will kill
all processes, including sysrqd!
